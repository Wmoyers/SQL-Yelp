# Project Summary
In this SQL project I explore a yelp dataset and practice profiling and understanding the data like a data analyst would.  I used various techniques including select statements, joins, where clauses, aggregate functions, order by, group by and a final anaylsis where I try to predict the number of fans a user will have based on their review_count, yelping_since, and elite_years.
